(2) ER diagram making <br/>
(3) Reducing ER diagram to relational schemas <br/>
(4) Checking if the schemas were in 3NF form <br/>
(5) Decomposing the problematic relations to 3NF <br/>
(6) Finding the highest normal form of all the relations <br/>
(7) Writing SQL queries to create the relations etc..
